    <h2>How to Cook Turkey In a Bag</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Turkey:</strong> Remove and discard the giblets, pat the turkey dry, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Pack the Bag:</strong> Sprinkle the bottom of the bag with flour. Place the turkey in the bag along with cut celery and onions. Seal the bag, transfer to a roasting pan, and use a fork to poke several holes in the bag.</li>
            <li><strong>Roast the Turkey:</strong> Bake in a preheated oven until the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh meat should read 180 degrees F.</li>
